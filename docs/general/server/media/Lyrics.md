# Lyrics
Lyrics are contained in the same folder and must match the filenames for their corresponding item. For example: The lyric file for `01 Death Eternal.mp3` must be `01 Death Eternal.lrc` or `01 Death Eternal.txt`

```
Music
└── Some Artist
    └── Album A
        ├── Song 1.flac
        ├── Song 1.lrc
        ├── Song 2.flac
        ├── Song 2.lrc
        ├── Song 3.flac
        └── Song 3.lrc
```

The Lyrics file can be synchronized or unsynchronized. It can have some extra metadata, but that won't be registered by Jellyfin.

### Synchronized
You can either synchronize lyrics by hand (which can be time consuming and not precise) or use any lrics synchronization software, like minilyrics.

[00:08.38]Are you (are you)
[00:10.44]Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to)
[00:14.31]Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to)
[00:18.25]It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
[00:22.69]
[00:23.94]Play fair (play fair)
[00:26.06]Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature)
[00:29.94]Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there (been there)
[00:33.75]And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (learn my lesson twice)
[00:38.82]
[00:41.50]But if you really wanna go there
[00:45.38]You should know I
```

### Unsynchronized
You can leave lyrics unsynchronized if you don't have the time to make lyrics by hand or don't have the software to do so.

```Unsynchronized
Are you (are you)
Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to)
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to)
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night

Play fair (play fair)
Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature)
Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there (been there)
And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (learn my lesson twice)

But if you really wanna go there
You should know I
